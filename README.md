# 🛰️ NeoOrbit
## Satellite Collision Predictor 

A **web-based 3D simulation tool** that visualizes satellites orbiting Earth and predicts potential collisions with mathematical accuracy. Built with a modern frontend and backend stack, it provides an interactive interface to add, remove, and reset satellites, while rendering real-time orbital paths around Earth.
